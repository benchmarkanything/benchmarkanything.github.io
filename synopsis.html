        <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          <code>BenchmarkAnything</code> consists of a data schema to represent measurement results,
          tools to work with such data, a data storage to store them, and a query data format
          to search in such a data store.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Measurementdata">Measurement data</h3>
        <p>
          The major data abstraction: a key/value like data structure - with a twist.
        </p>
        <p>
          See the following example, here expressed in YAML:
        </p>
        <pre class="wiki">BenchmarkAnythingData:
  - NAME: example.metric.name1
    VALUE: 12.3
    UNIT: s
    key1: info1
    key2: info2
  - NAME: example.metric.name1
    VALUE: 13.7
    UNIT: s
    key1: some-other-info
    key2: even-more-info
  - NAME: example.yet.another.metric
    VALUE: 87.2
    gerrit_change: 4226
    gerrit_branch: master
        </pre><p>
          It starts with hash entry <code>BenchmarkAnythingData</code> so that
          we can embed and find it inside surrounding other data,
          and the value of that hash entry is a list of hashes where
          each such list element represents a single data point of
          some measurement. Each such data point has a NAME for the metric
          it belongs to and a VALUE. These are the only two mandatory keys.
          Additionally there can be any other key/value pairs.</p>
        <p> By
          convention UPPERCASED keys are reserved for special meaning,
          like here the UNIT (the data storage augments it with some more,
          like a unique VALUE_ID and a CREATED timestamp).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is your choice how to split semantic meaning between the
          metric NAME and describing additional key/value pairs. It
          mostly depends on how you plan to query them later. Usually
          there is a balance between the complexity of metric names
          to express what the benchmark was about and does know by "itself",
          like
        </p>
        <ul><li><code>bmk.networking.iperf3.bandwidth.unidirectional</code>
        </li><li><code>bmk.networking.netcat.dd.devzero.duration.20.10.10M</code>
        </li></ul><p>
          and the additional keys to describe the environment in which the
          benchmark was executed and usually are contributed from some
          outer context that the benchmark itself does <strong>not</strong> know about.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the above example that detail <code>.20.10.10M</code> is already a hint
          about the cargo. You could argue to make this an additional key/value
          information. Deciding this in a way that makes your later evaluation
          more useful, is the hard part. :-)
        </p>
        <h3 id="Querylanguage">Query language</h3>
        <p>
          The query language is essentially a list of tuples consisting
          of a comparison operator, the key, and the searched value, plus
          some surrounding "influencers".

                  <h3 id="EmbeddingbenchmarkresultsinTAP">Embedding benchmark results in TAP</h3>
                  <p>
                    The <a class="ext-link" href="http://tapper.github.io/Tapper/"><span class="icon">​</span>Tapper</a> infrastructure has the whole BenchmarkAnything subsystem embedded. It
                    implicitely extracts and stores BenchmarkAnythingData from TAP results into a database
                    and provides web-form based simple dashboards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is also possible to embed BenchmarkAnything data in TAP output.

                    The key to this is that TAP allows embedded YAML between some begin/end
                    markers (<code>---</code> and <code>...</code>, .i.e., 3 dashes and 3 dots), like this:
                  </p>
                  <pre class="wiki">1..3

      VALUE:      0.956
      UNIT:       s
      cargo_size: 10485760
      magic_enabled: 1

  ...
ok - some other descriptio
                  </pre><p>
                    I.e., you have an anchoring <code>ok</code> line, followed by an embedded begin marker of 3 dashes <code>---</code>,
                    the actual results introduced with <code>BenchmarkAnythingData</code> followed by an array of results, and
                    an embedded end marker of 3 dots <code>...</code>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can have multiple such ok/YAML combinations, or multiple results inside the
                    same single array under <code>BenchmarkAnythingData</code>. All of the single data points will be
                    picked up and stored in the database.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's it.
